            <p>The City of Malabon University recently concluded its three-day Institutional Strategic Planning with the theme “CMU Thriving the Landscape in Higher Education” from November 28–30, 2023, at Microtel by Wyndham Baguio.
                During the event, Dr. Glen DV. De Leon, our University President, expressed his optimism for CMU’s enhanced engagement and innovation in services and operations. Dr. Willam Enrique, Vice President for Academic Affairs, provided an insightful overview of the strategic directions for the next four years based on the five-year development plan.
                The participants were grouped according to sub-core areas. The discussions focused on institutional identity, opportunities and threats, innovation and creativity, school environment and infrastructure development, governance and management, as well as student life and advancement. The collaborative effort resulted in the identification of the top five Institutional Goals and Priorities (IGPs) for the academic year 2024-2025. These IGPs were deemed the most feasible during the deliberations.
                We extend our gratitude to Dr. Alexander Rosete for his invaluable message and support for the university. To Atty. Regina Casidsid-Portento and Ms. Catherine Larracas for their participation and contributions during the seminar.
                The City of Malabon University remains committed to the continuous improvement of our institution for the benefit of both our staff and students. We appreciate the collective efforts of everyone involved in making this strategic planning session a success.
