            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>The City of Malabon University is a local university owned and operated by the local government unit of Malabon. Its primary purpose is to help promote
                 the interest and welfare of its people especially the youth by providing them with meaningful opportunities geared towards the demands of an emerging global village.
                  It was known first as the Malabon Community College in 1993 through Ordinance No. 14-1993 of the Municipal Council of Malabon. <br> <br>

                  It was temporarily located at Malabon High School, Panghulo Annex. The classes all started on June 1994 when it initially offered Bachelor of Science in Education,
                   Bachelor of Elementary Education, and Two-year Secretarial Courses. The first president was <strong>DR. PABLO S. TANGCO</strong> and the late <strong>MAYOR PROSPERO I. ORETA</strong> was 
                   the Ex-Officio Chairperson of the Board of Trustees. <br> <br>

                   In 1996, it was transferred to a more spacious lot at Pampano St. Corner Maya-maya St. Barangay Longos, Malabon City. <br> <br>

                   In 1997, Graduate Studies and Applied Research (GSAR) was offered for the first time. It catered to 43 MA students who used to be teachers from Malabon and Navotas. Soon MAED was followed by MAEM, MBA, MPA, and Doctoral courses. <br><br>

                   Next Chairperson of the Board was <strong>MAYOR AMADO VICENCIO</strong>. He led the City Council of Malabon on March 14, 2002, in amending City Ordinance No.14 S 1993 to enact the Malabon City College Charter, through the passage of City Ordinance No. 05,2002. <br><br>

                   Malabon had been a highly urbanized City. By virtue of a congressional act sponsored by <strong> HON. CONGRESSMAN FEDERICO S. SANDOVAL</strong>, the name Malabon City College was renamed as the City of Malabon University or CMU through an Ordinance No. 2003, approved by the City Council of Malabon on June 3, 2003. <br><br>

                   The first university president was <strong>DR. CORAZON VICARIO</strong>  who was succeeded by<strong> DR. ASUNCION R. HOWE</strong> until <strong>ATTY. RAMON MARONILLA</strong>  took over with <strong>CITY MAYOR CANUTO ORETA</strong>  and was Ex-Officio Chair of the Board of Regents. By then<strong> MAYOR ANTOLIN A. ORETA III</strong> took over as the university president himself.
                    <br><br>
                    The additional offering of courses did not stop from there, because lately the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Engineering and Technology, and the College of Criminology were opened.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, in the year 2022, CMU is still in its transition period, the Chair of the Board of Regents is<strong> MAYOR JEANNIE N. SANDOVAL</strong> with <strong>DR. GLEN DV DE LEON</strong> as OIC, President. <br><br>

                    After almost 28 years, the City of Malabon University (CMU) has grown to offerings of different programs. With the new set of statements of its vision, mission, and objectives, it is hoped that changes would occur in the process of finding where to go and how to go there.
